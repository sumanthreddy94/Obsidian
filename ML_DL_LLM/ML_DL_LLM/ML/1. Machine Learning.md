Machine Learning is a part of Applied Mathematics where we use tools or Math (Stats, Prob theory) to extract patterns from given datasets.

Examples in Dataset (or) Input & Desired Output =>  System => 
System figures out conversion between input and output

This process is called Training or Fitting

> Bikes & Prices of Bikes => ML System (FIt) => Trained Model (o/p)

> [!Usage of Trained Model]
> Bikes => Trained Model => Prices (Prediction)

### Model Fitting
| Scenario         | Description                            | Training Error | Test/Validation Error | Cause / When It Happens                                    | Consequence                            | How to Fix or Prevent                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Underfitting** | Model too simple to capture patterns   | High           | High                  | Model too simple or insufficient training                  | Poor performance on all data           | Increase model complexity, train longer, add features             |
| **Good Fit**     | Model captures true patterns well      | Low            | Low                   | Right model complexity and data amount                     | Best generalization, good predictions  | Maintain current approach, regularization as needed               |
| **Overfitting**  | Model memorizes noise in training data | Low            | High                  | Model too complex, too many features, or insufficient data | Poor generalization, fails on new data | Use regularization, get more data, simplify model, early stopping |
### Types Of Machine Learning
- Supervised
Labelled Datasets, we have features and targets, X and Y 
ML Models: Linear Reg, Logistic Reg, Bagging Algo,  Random Forest, Boosting Algorithm

- Unsupervised
We have only Features, We Just have X
So we find patterns in dataset, Grouping the dataset, => Clustering

- Reinforcement Learning
Learn By Trail and Error, Learn by previous Experience => Morkov Model
