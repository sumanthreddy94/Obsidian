Find A line between Labels that best separates or divides the data

In 2 D its a line, for multiple Dimensions  we need Hyper plane

Not only separation, We care about boundary,
Margin: perpendicular Distance between Closest value for classes,

Maximize these margins: We need a line that maximize these margins

Support Vectors: Datapoints that lie on these margin lines are Support Vectors


***Not so Robust to outliers***
If there is one or more outliers that would shift the line significantly 
Avoid SVM for more outliers

### Kernel Trick
If there are different groups of data we can transform the feature to change the curve of feature for clear Separation 
X -> (X ,  X^2)
