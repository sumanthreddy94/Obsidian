### Outcome:

Classify Data
Optimize ML Performance
Predict Outcome -> Regression, Classification
Analyse Different types of Data -> Time Series Data

### Features:

1. Qualitative - Nominal Data: Finite Categorical Data Without Inherent Order
Normalized
One Hot Encoding -> USA [1,0,0,0] , India [0,1,0,0]

2. Qualitative - Ordinal Data: Inherent Order Sad 0-> Grumpy -> 1 , Normal -> 2, Happy -> 4
3. Quantitative - Discreet  : Numerical Valued Data Count, Discreet: Count Number 
4. Quantitative - Continues: Continuous Valued Data,  Continuous: Length, Temperature

### Models:

### ML Tasks:
### 1. Supervised
1. Classification
- Binary Classification one or the other Eg: Spam not Spam for email
- Multiclass Classification: More than two classes eg: Animals: Dog, Cat, Rat, Pigeon
2. Regression: Linear Regression
	Predict Continuous Value
